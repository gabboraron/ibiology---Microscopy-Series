Resolving power of the light microscope; the [resolution limits of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system): $d=\frac{\lambda}{2nsin\alpha}$ where $d$ is the distance about how far apart two objects are where they can still be distinguised as separate objects; $λ$ is the wavelength of light; $n$ is the index of refraction of the medium being imaged in; and $\alpha$ is the half-angle subtended by the optical objective lens. Here $nsin\alpha$ is the [numerical aperture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_aperture) that characterizes the range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light.

Green Fluorescence Protein is not compatible with the live cell imaging but is a subtatial improvement over immonuflourescence.

> Light microscopes use lenses. The basic properties of light, how light interacts with matter, the principles behind refractive lenses and how lenses form (magnified) images will be introduced in this talk.


> ***These equations will tell you where the light it's going to go.***

speed = wavelength (m) x frequency (1/s)

intensity = power / area

amplitude = $\sqrt{intensity}$

frequency = $\frac{speed}{wavelength}$

refraction *(sign:* $n$ *)* = $\frac{\text{speed of light in vacuum}}{\text{speed of light in material}}$

### Light - matter interaction:

**[law of reflection](https://www.britannica.com/science/reflection-physics): $\phi_{in} = \phi_{out}$**

The angle of incidence is equal with the reflection.

|![reflection_light_angle](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/reflection-light-angle-incidence.png)|![reflection in video](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/refractive_lenses_and_image_formation/light-matter_reflection.png)|
|--|--|


**Refraction is the bending of light (it also happens with sound, water and other waves) as it passes from one transparent substance into another. [Law of refrection](https://www.britannica.com/science/refraction): $n_isin(\phi_i) = n_rsin(\phi_t)$** In this [equation](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/316/lectures/node128.html) $\phi_1$ is the angle subtended between the incident ray and the normal to the interface, and $\phi_2$ is the angle subtended between the refracted ray and the normal to the interface. The quantities $n_1$ and $n_2$ are termed the refractive indices of media 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, the law of refraction predicts that a light-ray always deviates more towards the normal in the optically denser medium: i.e., the medium with the higher refractive index. By definition, the refractive index $n$ of a dielectric medium of dielectric constant $K$ is given by $n=\sqrt{K}$. [Table](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/316/lectures/node128.html#t12.1) below shows the refractive indices of some common materials (for yellow light of wavelength $\lambda =589$ nm).

| material | $n$ |
| --- | --- |
| air | 1.00029 |
| water | 1.33 |
| ice | 1.31 |
| glass | 1.52 |
| light flint | 1.58 |
| heavy flint | 1.65 |
| heaviest flint | 1.89 |
| diamond | 2.42 |

The law of refraction follows directly from the fact that the speed $v$ with which light propagates through a dielectric medium is inversely proportional to the refractive index of the medium $v = \frac{c}{n}$, where $c$ is the speed of the light.

| ![refraction](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/Refraction-of-light-in-water20150805-30610-expmepedited.png) | ![low of refraction](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/law-refraction-angle-light-ray-Snell-medium.gif) |
|---- | ---- | 

[**The amount of bending depends on two things:**](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/49-refraction-of-light)
- **Change in speed** – if a substance causes the light to speed up or slow down more, it will refract (bend) more.
- **Angle of the incident ray** – if the light is entering the substance at a greater angle, the amount of refraction will also be more noticeable. On the other hand, if the light is entering the new substance from straight on (at 90° to the surface), the light will still slow down, but it won’t change direction at all.

The law of refraction, also known as [Snell’s law](https://www.britannica.com/science/Snells-law), describes the relationship between the angle of incidence ($\phi_1$) and the angle of refraction ($\phi_2$), measured with respect to the normal (“perpendicular line”) to the surface, in mathematical terms: $n_1 sin \phi_1 = n_2 sin \phi_2$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the index of refraction of the first and second media, respectively.

> ***These equations will tell you how much light will going to.***

$$transmitted + reflected + absorbed = \text{total amount of light}$$

$$\text{(reflection)  }R=(\frac{n_t-n_i}{n_t+n_i})^2$$

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations#Normal_incidence) assume the $\phi_i = \phi_t = 0$.

$$T=\frac{4n_i n_t}{(n_t+n_i)^2}$$

When the light goes throught several surfaces we can sum is as different refractions. This happens wen we use lenses and it is described by the [lensmaker's equation](http://www.physicsbootcamp.org/lens-maker-equation.html): $\frac{1}{f} = (n-1)(\frac{1}{R_1}-\frac{1}{R_2})$ where $f$ is the focal length, and $R_1$, $R_2$ are the radius of the circle which create the lens. When one surface of the lens is flat than then it means that you can set $R_2 = \infty$. Also you can set the thickness of the lens by $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{(n_1-n_0)}{n_0}(\frac{1}{R_1}-\frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{(n_1-n_0)d}{n_1R_1R_2})$  If the lens is operating in air, then set $n_0=1$, like in the previous equation.

| --- | --- |


At the focus point the light is has a distribution density.

![focus_point](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/refractive_lenses_and_image_formation/focus_point.png)

**Ray tracing:** parallel rays will go to the focus after lens and and will be parallel after lens if it comes from a focus.

*Thin lens equation:* $\frac{1}{f} = (\frac{1}{s_0} + \frac{1}{s_i})$ where $s_0$ is the distance from the object to the lens, and $s_i$ is the distance from lens to image and $f$ is the focal length of the lens.

*magnification:* $M=\frac{y_i}{y_0}=- \frac{s_i}{s_0}$ where $y_0$ is the object and $y_i$ is the image height.

The relationship between the focal lengths of the objective lens ($f_{obj}$), tube lens ($f_{tube}$), and the total magnification (M) is given by the formula: $M=-\frac{f_{tube}}{f_{obj}}$

## Microscope Imaging and Koehler Illumination (Ron Vale, HHMI/UCSF)

> This lecture covers the lenses of the microscope and how they are used to focus light onto a specimen and how light from the specimen is focused onto a camera or the retina of an eye.  Koehler illumination, which provides even illumination of a sample, is described.


*info:* many microscope lens created earlier than 20 years has a 160mm image distance.

Nowdays mostly we use infinity lens whith tube lens. In this case the magnification will be $M=\frac{f_1}{f_0}$ where $f_1$ is the focal length of the tube lens and $f_0$ is the focal length of the objective lens which is a much smaller number. 

| ![tube lens](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscope%20Imaging%20and%20Koehler%20Illumination%20(Ron%20Vale)/tubelens.png) | ![projecting_the_imge_to_your_eye](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscope%20Imaging%20and%20Koehler%20Illumination%20(Ron%20Vale)/projecting_the_imge_to_your_eye.png) | ![projecting_the_imge_to_camera](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscope%20Imaging%20and%20Koehler%20Illumination%20(Ron%20Vale)/projecting_the_imge_to_camera.png) |
| ----- | ---- | ---- |

Here as you see we used [eyepiece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyepiece), we will talk about this later.


### The other question is the illumination of the microscope

With the Köhler illumination we can have defocused light  which don't disturb the image.

| ![köhler_illumination](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscope%20Imaging%20and%20Koehler%20Illumination%20(Ron%20Vale)/keohler.png) | ![köhler illumination, the path of the light and the path of the image](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/1024px-Kohler_Illumination_en.svg.png) |
| --------------------- | --------- | 
| [Köhler illumination](https://www.scientifica.uk.com/learning-zone/a-6-step-guide-to-koehler-illumination) | [Schematics of Köhler illumination.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6hler_illumination) Top: Illumination beam path, conjugated planes marked with the light green bar. Bottom: Imaging beam path, conjugated planes marked with the light blue bar. See text for further details. |

[Critical illumination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_illumination) (below), focuses an image of a light source on to the specimen for bright illumination. Critical illumination generally has problems with evenness of illumination as an image of the illumination source (for example a halogen lamp filament) is visible in the resulting image. Köhler illumination has largely replaced critical illumination in modern scientific light microscopy although it requires additional optics which may not be present in less expensive and simpler light microscopes.

*info:* [Five steps for Koehler Illumination](https://www.leica-microsystems.com/science-lab/microscopy-basics/koehler-illumination-a-brief-history-and-a-practical-set-up-in-five-easy-steps/)

### Conjugate focal plane
> In optics, a [conjugate plane or conjugate focal plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_focal_plane) of a given plane P, is the plane P′ such that points on P are imaged on P′. If an object is moved to the point occupied by its image, then the moved object's new image will appear at the point where the object originated.

The field diaphragm simply controls the amount of light which finally reaches the slide on the stage. By controlling the amount of light coming from the light source, you are able to reduce glare from the source and this results in images with greater contrast. The field diaphragm is usually controlled by a knurled ring around the lens.

| ---- | ----- |
| The image of field diaphragm has an image on the sample and on the camer as well, but this works only with proper Köhler illumination. | [The main components of an upright microscope.](https://www.leica-microsystems.com/science-lab/microscopy-basics/koehler-illumination-a-brief-history-and-a-practical-set-up-in-five-easy-steps/) The Field diaphragm controls the intensity of light from the source. The condenser focusses the light from the light source on the specimen. The aperture diaphragm controls the angle of the illumination light cone.  |

> Microscope lenses are highly complex optical elements that correct for many different optical aberrations. This lecture describes a number of these aberrations and discusses what you should consider when selecting objective lenses as well as other precautions you can take to reduce the effects of aberrations.

### Optical Aberrations
It is always a tradeoff between the correction versus transmission and numerical aperture. Plan version are flat-field corrected, so that when you look in the eyepiece you can see a flat corrected field.

Apochromat lenses are the more correctted lenses, but don't forget, more glass in the lens to correct the lens, more transmission is losed!

| ![lenstypesandcorrections](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/lenstypesandcorrections.png) | ![aberrations](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/aberration.png) | ![numerical aperture](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/numericalaperture.png) |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------ |

#### Numerical aperture
> More in [ Encyclopedia of Materials: Science and Technology (Second Edition)](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/related_documents/Optical_Microscopy-AS_HOLIK.pdf)
 
$$NA = nsin\phi$$
Where $NA$ is [numerical aperture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/sdfe/pdf/download/eid/3-s2.0-B0080431526011426/first-page-pdf), $n$ is the refractive index of the medium between the objective lens and the object *(air = 1.0; water = 1.33, oil = 1.515)*; $sin\phi$ is the angle of the cone of illumination; $\phi$ is half the angular aperture (or acceptance angle of image-forming rays) of the objective lens. This is why we can increase the magnification with immersion media.

| ![numerical_aperture](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/numerical_aperture.png) | ![immersion_media](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/immersion_media.png) |
| ------------------- |----- |

#### Curvature of field 
Due the curved surface of the lens you cant get the focus of the whole image at the same time.

Curvature of field is present when the sharpest image is formed not on a flat plane but on a curved surface. See in the thrd image, the image "plane" (the arc) deviates from a flat surface (the vertical line).

| ![fieldcurvature](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/fieldcurvature.png) | ![Curvature of field](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/aberration-curvature-field.gif) | ![Field curvature: the image "plane" (the arc) deviates from a flat surface (the vertical line).](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/Field_curvature.svg) |
| ------------------- |----- | --- |

#### Astigmatism
A point source of the light which appears as a line or ellipse, and when you go through focus it changes its directionality in other way. High quality lenses don't heve such, just if you drop it. Occurs when thelens is curved more steeply in one direction than in another. [On the right picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism_(optical_systems)) you can see the image of point G is at point $B_M$ for rays in plane M, and at point $B_S$ for rays in plane S.

| ![astigmatism](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/astigmatism.png) | ![Astigmatism: The image of point G is at point BM for rays in plane M, and at point BS for rays in plane S.](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/Meridional%2BSagittalPlane.png) |
| ------------------- |----- |

#### Coma
Coma of a single lens: each cone of light focuses on different planes along the optical axis.

| ![coma](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/coma.png) | ![coma](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/Lens_coma.svg) |
| ------------------- |----- |

#### Axial chromatic and spherical aberration

| ![spherical aberration](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/Spherical-aberration-disk.jpg) |A point source as imaged by a system with negative (top), zero (center), and positive (bottom) spherical aberration. Images to the left are defocused toward the inside, images on the right toward the outside|
| --- | --- |

Each manufacturer matching the immersion oil to their lenses, because other type can  induce axial chromatic aberration. The spherical aberration appears because in the reality there is no such thing as ideal thin lens, they have volume and curved surfaces. Common causes of spherical aberration  are the incorrect slip thickness, mismatch of the reflective index.

Because of this nowdays the lens systems are extreamly complex systems. To solve this we have to know the optical path length. The $OPL$ is the physical length of every material in that optical system, times its refractive index, summed up through the entire lens system to the point in the specimen that you'are imaging. 

$$OPL = ((L_1 \times n_1) + (L_2 \times n_2) ... + (L_n \times n_n))$$

Where $L$ is the physical distance, $n$ is the refractive index of the mounting media *(air = 1.0; water = 1.33, glycerin=1.47, oil = 1.515)*
But in this equation the immersion media is a variable, immersion media decreases its refractive index as it warms up! Coverglasses ha a 10% $\pm$ thickness range. The specimen may vary in a long range, depends on the material.

> Light has properties of particles and waves. Understanding the wave nature of light is essential to understanding the workings of a microscope. This lecture describes Huygens Wavelets, constructive/destructive interference, and diffraction.

$$d \cdot sin \theta = n \lambda$$
[Where](https://isaacphysics.org/concepts/cp_diffraction?stage=all): $d$ is the distance between slits; $\theta$ is diffraction angle; $n$ is the order number for the maximum; $\lambda$ wavelength

A [pinhole camera, or camera obscura](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/Pinhole-camera.svg%20-%20Wikipedia.png) simply create an image about the object if you put a paper in a good focus distance.

This is the good example for the light is not travelling in rays, because if it would then we can get a larger image if we move the paper backward. As we can see in the [wave optis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/wave-optics), we have plane waves, because it is not just going up and down, but it is a 3D imensional thing, and there are a lot of planes behind each other.


![waveoptics](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Huygens%20Wavelets%20ConstructiveDestructive%20Interference%2C%20and%20Diffraction/waveoptics.png)

[Plane waves](https://www.nde-ed.org/Physics/Waves/planewaves.xhtml) are a special case of waves where a physical quantity, such as phase, is constant over a plane that is perpendicular to the direction of wave travel. There can be mechanical (both transverseand longitudinal) as well as EM plane waves. It should be noted that EM plane waves are only transverse. A visualization of a plane wave is shown below. Just like periodic waves, plane waves have a wavelength, frequency, and wave speed. 

| ![planewave](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Huygens%20Wavelets%20ConstructiveDestructive%20Interference%2C%20and%20Diffraction/planewave.png) | ![plane wave structure](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/plane%20wave.png) |
| ---- | --- | 

When EM waves radiate from a source, such as an antenna, they radiate as [spherical waves](https://academo.org/demos/spherical-waves/) (see the figure below). As the waves move farther from the source, their energy gets spread out over a bigger spherical surface area. At big distances, which we call the far-field, a spherical wave front can be approximated as a uniform plane wave over a defined area.  

| ![spherical vs plane wave](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/plane_waves.gif) | ![spherical wave](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/spherical%20wave.png) |
| ---- | --- | 

Here clearly we can see that how the waves "power" is missed if we increase the surface. [The equation below](https://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/q-does-strength-proximity-effect-depend-volume-source) describe this: $$intensity = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$$ where $P$ is the point source power.

> ### To understand better this, we have some basic definitions
>
> #### Velocity
> The distance covered by the wave in unit time.
>
> #### Frequency
> The number of complete disturbances (cycles) in unit time. Usually expressed in Hertz
>
> #### Wavelength
> The distance between successive points of equal phase in a wave.

$$\text{wavelenght } (\lambda) = \frac{\text{Velocity (v)}}{Frequency (f)}$$

### waves

Why intensity of a light wave is proportional to the $amplitude^2$ ? Generating a 4X larger wave requires 4 times the force over four times the distance = 16 times the energy. When such a wave imparts its energy to a detector we measure its enery as intensity: hence 4 times the amplitude is 16 times as brightness!

The intensity of a wave is the wavelet. The wavelet is the component that generates plane waves and spherical waves, [as Hyugens wrote it](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99049-7).

### Interference
The waves can make each other "stronger" or "weaker" based on the point where they intersect. This makes the [pinholes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_(optics)) able to work.

> An infinitesimally small point appears in the microscope as a spot with a certain size, blurred in the z-direction and with concentric rings around it. This “point spread function” reveals many of the optical properties of your microscope. This lecture explains why and how the microscope images a point as a point spread function.

| ---------- | ---- |---- |
| Here the *Objective* is a microsope objective, which is a complex lens system basically. The *Objective* is exactly in the focal distance, from the *point source*, that's why we can say that the point is in focus for this lens. In this image, this lens turns the [spherical wave](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/related_documents/lecture12_1-Reflection%20and%20Refraction.pdf) into [plane waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_wave). The plane waves arrive to a tube lens, which can take plane wave and turn into a converging spherical wave, so the tube lens focused on that point in the image plane. | What happens with the light beyond the tube lens: THe Huygen's view converging the spherical wave a series of infinitesimally small wavelets. Each of the infinite points in the emerging wave front acts like a spoint source itself. Each point emits a [wavelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet), and all wavelets from the same wave front are mutually coherent. That's why they ascillate in synchrony, because they came from the same source. Therefore they interfere with each other in a predictable way we can quantify where the light will be and where the light won't be over a wavelength's time slot. | If there are two wavelets equally distant from the center line than those point both be peaking and troughing in synchrony and thei phase will be exactly the same. If we add it, they will add in the constructive interference. But if we choose a lower position then on of the waves will have a longer wavelength, in total they will have a half wavelength difference, creating a destructive interference. But again lower we can see that the wavelength is exactly one wavelength longer, so it will help each other creating a constructive interference. If we see this in every point then we can see that this happens in all of the points on the image plane. |

> ### Point spread function [(PSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_spread_function)
> 
> *Generally, a source of light can be considered a [point source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_source) if the resolution of the imaging instrument is too low to resolve the source's apparent size. There are two types and sources of light: a point source and an extended source. Mathematically an object may be considered a point source if its angular size,* $\theta$ , *is much smaller than the [resolving power of the telescope](https://unacademy.com/content/neet-ug/study-material/physics/resolving-power-of-microscopes-and-astronomical-telescopes/):* $$\theta << \frac{\lambda}{D}$$ *where* $\lambda$ *is the wavelength of light and* $D$ *is the diameter of telescope. Remember: telescopes having a larger* $D$ *or large diameter of the lens have a better resolving power. It also depends on light’s wavelength.*

| Down here you can see the integration of wavelets  overa full wavelength end then squered so we see amplitudes rather than wavelengths, which is a different pattern then the instantenous wave pattern, what we can see at the top. Detectors collect intensity. Intensity is a full cycle squered. The detected interference pattern has dark and bright lines. There is one single bright line running right down the horizontal middle, because that's equdistant from the two points everywhere along that line. The dark places are with destructive interference, where is no light, and the bright areas are therefore the constructive interference. | Those wavelets determinate the resolution of the microscope  are most related to the numerical aperture of the lens. Here we can see three different objectives with different numerical aperture. Numerical aperture is measured as the index of refraction of the material between the objective and the speciment *(if it's air then index of refraction is 1; for oil it is higher!)* and it's index of refractions times the sinus of the half-angle between a normal vertical light $\alpha$ ; which means $$NA=n \cdot sin(\alpha)$$ .  | Difference between high and low NA is how much the spherical cap is collected, and therefore how much of the spherical cap exists converging back to that point. |

| The final image is related to fringe period. Any wavelets that closer together can generate bigger structure, so it's related to how fine this fringe period can be. | The other thing what determines the quality is the wavelength of the light. |

Airy disk equation is about the center of the light and the first black ring: $\frac{0.61 \cdot \lambda}{NA}$ , where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light; $NA$ is the numerical aperture. More spread along the optical axis, (z axis), first dark island at $\frac{2n \cdot \lambda}{NA^2}$ where $n$ is the index of refraction *(the medium of objective and specimen)*, the else is the same. We can see that the numerical aperture can create much more problems with the depth of imaging then in the plane.

>
> The resolution of a microscope can be defined as the smallest distance at which two small objects can still be seen as separate objects. This lecture discusses various criteria for resolution, the factors that influence resolution in the lateral and axial planes, and how to sample an image adequately using a camera or confocal microscope, such that the full optical resolution is retained.

This question is not about how close they are in real space, it is about how close they are in image space and still we can resolve as separate objects. There is no generally-accepted criterion but most microscopists use the Rayleigh criterion, partly because the distance between two points is $\frac{0.61 \lambda}{NA} $ if we talk about the lateral criterion. If we talk about the depth criterion in xz or yz then this is $\frac{2n \lambda}{NA^2}$

> ### Rayleigh criterion
>
> [The Rayleigh criterion](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/phyopt/Raylei.html) is the generally accepted criterion for the minimum resolvable detail - the imaging process is said to be diffraction-limited when the first diffraction minimum of the image of one source point coincides with the maximum of another.

> | ----- | ----- |
> | Single slit | Circular aperture |
> 
> If all parts of an imaging system are considered to be perfect, then the resolution of any imaging process will be limited by diffraction. Considering the single slit expression above, then when the wavelength is equal to the slit width, the angle for the first diffraction minimum is 90°. This means that the wave is spread all the way to the plane of the slit and will not contain resolvable information about the source of the wave. This leads to the simplified statement that the limit of resolution of any imaging process is going to be on the order of the wavelength of the wave used to image it.

This can be solved if we increase the number of pixels, but what should be the exact number? This is told by [Nyquist limit](https://imb.uq.edu.au/research/facilities/microscopy/training-manuals/microscopy-online-resources/image-capture/nyquist-conditions), which  *"states that a periodic signal must be sampled at more than twice the highest frequency component of the signal. In imaging, we recommend sampling at least 2.3X the highest frequency."* : $0.3 \lambda / NA$ .

> | Let's look at this first example where we collect an image over time. In other words, for a cell with diameter of 10 um that moves at 5 um/ minute, calculation: $$\frac{10 um}{2.3 \cdot 5 \frac{um}{m}} = \text{52 secs}$$ Therefore, we need to sample the data with a time resolution of a minimum of 52 seconds to be able to capture the movement correctly. Here, we are able to visualize the cell moving from the top left corner, to the bottom right corner and reliably determine it is the same cell. However, if we collect an image every 2 minutes, we cannot determine if this is the same cell, or if these are 2 different cells. However, if instead of tracking the entire cell, we are interested in tracking the nucleus which is 5 um in diameter, then we would need to collect another image every 26 seconds. $$\frac{5um}{2.3 \cdot 5 \frac{um}{min}} = \text{26 sec}$$ | Likewise, if the width of your cell is 10 um, you need XY resolution to be less than 5um to be able to resolve 2 cells next to each other. |

> *Resolution is the ability of an objective to definitively resolve an object, or group of objects, as a single entity(s). Magnification plays no part in the ability of an objective to resolve an object of a given size. While magnification will make an image bigger, it will not necessarily make it clearer. Resolution is governed solely by the Numerical Aperture (NA) of the objective, the wavelength of light and for axial resolution, the refractive index of the sample. Magnification will affect how much light the objective can collect. Higher magnification objectives collect less light, so where possible use the highest NA, lowest magnification objective available.*
>
> *It is important when discriminating small structures that the [Nyquist Sampling Criteria](https://imb.uq.edu.au/research/facilities/microscopy/training-manuals/microscopy-online-resources/image-capture/nyquist-conditions) is satisfied. Nyquist Sampling dictates that to optimally represent an analogue signal in digital space, **the analogue signal needs to be sampled at least 2.3 times. In microscopy terms this means that the pixel size of an image needs to be at least 2.3 times smaller than the object that is being resolved.***

Various aspects of all three of these descriptions are presented, such as ray tracing, wavelength, frequency, refraction, dispersion, diffraction, interference, the photoelectric effect and photons as the quantized energy of light.

### Light is a ray

It is easy to think about the light as rays. We can explain a lot phenomena with this idea, such as focal and image length; focal point; lens maker equation or ray tracing.

### Light is a wave

What we can't explain with the idea of rays we can explain as waves and the oscillation of waves. A wave has a few descriptor, such as wavelength $\lambda$ which is a the length between two oscillation or the number of oscillations, $\nu$ which is the frequancy. These sets the speed of the light $c=\nu \lambda = \text{2992792458 m/s in vacuum}$ .If we want to see it in other medium then we can calculate like this: $n=\frac{c}{\text{speed in the medium}} = \frac{ \lambda_{vacuum}}{ \lambda_{medium}}$ This is the refractive index, which tell you the direction of the light based on [Snell's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law): $n_1 sin \theta_1 = n_2 sin \theta_2$ .

Based on this we can add waves to each other, this is interference. If the distance betwee n two added waves peak position is enough small $\Delta \varphi$ the waves will help each other and it will be constructive interference. If not than we call destructive interference. Of course if we have a thin glass than the refraction depends on the wavelength and as wee see the depth of the glass as well. But in most cases we don't have such pure interference.

$$\text{light propagation = diffraction + interference}$$

In a diffraction if we have an incoming plane wave then after the diffraction in reality we have plane waves again because of the interference, because a plane wave technically is a lot of spherical waves. To describe this if we have a point after the aperture, and all kind of light waves are coming to this point, each of them has [amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude) $A$ with travel distance $l$. So the amplitude at total at this point will be $\sum A_i sin(\frac{2 \pi l_i}{\lambda})$ which makes the intensity in this point $I = A^2$ .

### Light is a particle of an electromagnetic wave
To understand this we need [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations): 

$$\nabla \cdot E = \frac{ \rho }{ \varepsilon_0 }$$
Coulumb's law says charges can generate static electric field. The electric field is proportional with the charge density.

$$\nabla \cdot B = 0$$
The magnetic force lines forms circles. There is no charge for magnetic fields. 

$$\nabla \cdot E = \frac{\delta B}{ \delta t}$$
Changing magnetic field generates electric field.

$$\nabla \cdot B = \mu_0J + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\delta E}{ \delta t}$$
The electric current and changing electric field generate magentic field.

The light is an electric field which generates a magnetic field which generates a magnetic field....

We can see this if we use a polarizer because these waves are perpendicular to each other.

> The Fourier transform is intimately associated with microscopy, since the alternating planes occurring in the microscope (focal plane – back-focal plane, etc.) are related to each other by a function very similar to the Fourier transform. This lectures explains the Fourier transform in terms understandable to non-mathematicians, and explains the relations with microscopy.

We have $I(r) = A sin(k \cdot r + \varphi_0$ and  $F(x) = \sum G(x) sin(k x)$. Fourier transform is about to cconvert one sinusoid function to a squered function. This is the way how e transform an image into a Furier image which is in frequency space. We can do the inverse direction too.

## Darkfield and Phase Contrast Microscopy (Edward Salmon, University of North Carolina)

> 
> This lecture describe the principles of dark field and phase contrast microscopy, two ways of generating contrast in a specimen which may be hard to see by bright field. The lecture describes how the phase rings work to generate interference between the diffracted and undiffracted light.

The purpose of darkfield microscopy is what we can see on the second image, and it's working like as it is showed on the fst image. Darkfield illumination is where cone of light is with $NA_{cond}>NA_{obj}$ ; objective iris prevents light entering objective. The scattered light generated by light field being focused by the speciement is collected by the objective and it is focused on the image plane. Here we can say that high NA is high resolution.

Advantages of darkfield :
- high sensitivity - black background provides high contrast to see scattered light for small objectives
- excellent fro low magnification outlines of individual cells

Disatvantages of darkfield: 
- resolution limited by need for $NA_{cond}>NA_{obj}$
- scattered light in thick specimens lowers contrast of fine structural detail
- poor dept of field
- often inaccurate images because missing interference with undiffracted light
- special light sources

Based on the speciment light is generated with the interference of diffracted and undiffracted light. In phase contras we use [Annular illumination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/annular-illumination) method what is a method of apertured exposure in a wafer stepper that changes the optical pathway and incident landing angle of incoming light. The condenser annulus is typically constructed as an opaque flat-black (light absorbing) plate with a transparent annular ring, which is positioned in the front focal plane (aperture) of the condenser so the specimen can be illuminated by defocused, parallel light wavefronts emanating from the ring. The microscope condenser images the annular diaphragm at infinity, while the objective produces an image at the rear focal plane. 

The phase ring:
- dimaeter: 50% of $NA_{obj}$
- condenser annulus diameter must be match to phase ring!
- condenser annulus must be aligned with phase ring in the objective

Conclusion: the most important parameter in the basic design of a phase contrast microscope is to isolate the surround and diffracted light waves emerging from the specimen so that they occupy different locations in the diffraction plane at the rear aperture of the objective. Explores light pathways through a phase contrast microscope and dissects the incident electromagnetic wave into surround (S), diffracted (D), and resultant (particle; P) components.

Polarized light is a contrast-enhancing technique that improves the quality of the image obtained with birefringent materials when compared to other techniques such as darkfield and brightfield illumination, differential interference contrast, phase contrast, Hoffman modulation contrast, and fluorescence. Polarized light microscopes have a high degree of sensitivity and can be utilized for both quantitative and qualitative studies targeted at a wide range of anisotropic specimens. Qualitative polarizing microscopy is very popular in practice, with numerous volumes dedicated to the subject. In contrast, the quantitative aspects of polarized light microscopy, which is primarily employed in crystallography, represent a far more difficult subject that is usually restricted to geologists, mineralogists, and chemists. However, steady advances made over the past few years have enabled biologists to study the birefringent character of many anisotropic sub-cellular assemblies.

[Birefringence](https://www.microscopyu.com/techniques/polarized-light/principles-of-birefringence) is formally defined as the double refraction of light in a transparent, molecularly ordered material, which is manifested by the existence of orientation-dependent differences in refractive index. Many transparent solids are optically isotropic, meaning that the index of refraction is equal in all directions throughout the crystalline lattice.

## Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) Microscopy (Edward Salmon, University of North Carolina)

> Differential Interference Contrast (sometimes known as Normarski microscopy) is a variation of polarization microscopy which generates a high contrast “shadow” image of a specimen. The mechanism of the DIC (Wollaston) prisms is discussed along with how to generate optimal contrast.

[Differential Interference Contrast (DIC)](https://www.scientifica.uk.com/learning-zone/differential-interference-contrast) is a microscopy technique that introduces contrast to images of specimens which have little or no contrast when viewed using brightfield microscopy. The images produced using DIC have a pseudo 3D-effect, making the technique ideal for electrophysiology experiments. Using DIC produces high resolution images with good contrast. It is best for visualising unstained samples. When viewing fluorescently labelled compounds, using DIC reduces the fluorescence intensity slightly and so decreases the quality of fluorescence images. However, this decrease is not significant. As an Infrared (IR) light source is usually used, DIC is ideal for imaging thick specimens such as brain slices, as IR light penetrates deeper into tissues than visible light, due to its longer wavelength. An advantage of using DIC over other contrast techniques, such as phase contrast or oblique contrast is that in DIC the full aperture of the microscope is used. For example, in phase contrast, the annulus of the condenser restricts the aperture, reducing the resolution of the image. Unlike phase contrast, DIC images are not disturbed by halo artefacts.

**How does Differential Interference Contrast work?**

In DIC, light emitted from the source is linearly polarised by passing through a polariser. The linearly polarised beam of light enters an objective-specific prism, which splits it into two rays that vibrate perpendicular to each other. The rays are parallel as they pass through a condenser, but as they are vibrating perpendicular to each other, they are unable to cause interference.

The split beams pass through the specimen. The specimen’s varying thickness and refractive indices alter the wave paths of the beams. They then enter the objective, where they are focussed above the rear focal plane. The two beams enter a second prism, in the nosepiece, which combines them. Because the beams passed through different parts of the specimen, they have different lengths.

The analyser, which is a second polariser, brings the vibrations of the beams into the same plane and axis, causing destructive and constructive interference to occur between the two wavefronts. The light then travels to the eyepiece or camera, where a DIC image with differences in intensity and colour, can be seen. 

The most fundamental distinction between differential interference contrast ([DIC](https://www.microscopyu.com/tutorials/comparison-of-phase-contrast-and-dic-microscopy)) and phase contrast microscopy is the optical basis upon which images are formed by the complementary techniques. Specimens examined by these contrast-enhancing methods produce images that are often quite different in appearance and character when objectively compared. This interactive tutorial explores many of the similarities and differences exhibited between images captured with phase contrast and DIC microscopy.
