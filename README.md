Resolving power of the light microscope; the [resolution limits of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system): $d=\frac{\lambda}{2nsin\alpha}$ where $d$ is the distance about how far apart two objects are where they can still be distinguised as separate objects; $λ$ is the wavelength of light; $n$ is the index of refraction of the medium being imaged in; and $\alpha$ is the half-angle subtended by the optical objective lens. Here $nsin\alpha$ is the [numerical aperture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_aperture) that characterizes the range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light.

> Light microscopes use lenses. The basic properties of light, how light interacts with matter, the principles behind refractive lenses and how lenses form (magnified) images will be introduced in this talk.


> ***These equations will tell you where the light it's going to go.***

speed = wavelength (m) x frequency (1/s)

intensity = power / area

amplitude = $\sqrt{intensity}$

frequency = $\frac{speed}{wavelength}$

refraction *(sign:* $n$ *)* = $\frac{\text{speed of light in vacuum}}{\text{speed of light in material}}$

### Light - matter interaction:

**[law of reflection](https://www.britannica.com/science/reflection-physics): $\phi_{in} = \phi_{out}$**

The angle of incidence is equal with the reflection.

|![reflection_light_angle](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/reflection-light-angle-incidence.png)|![reflection in video](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/refractive_lenses_and_image_formation/light-matter_reflection.png)|
|--|--|


**Refraction is the bending of light (it also happens with sound, water and other waves) as it passes from one transparent substance into another. [Law of refrection](https://www.britannica.com/science/refraction): $n_isin(\phi_i) = n_rsin(\phi_t)$** In this [equation](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/316/lectures/node128.html) $\phi_1$ is the angle subtended between the incident ray and the normal to the interface, and $\phi_2$ is the angle subtended between the refracted ray and the normal to the interface. The quantities $n_1$ and $n_2$ are termed the refractive indices of media 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, the law of refraction predicts that a light-ray always deviates more towards the normal in the optically denser medium: i.e., the medium with the higher refractive index. By definition, the refractive index $n$ of a dielectric medium of dielectric constant $K$ is given by $n=\sqrt{K}$. [Table](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/316/lectures/node128.html#t12.1) below shows the refractive indices of some common materials (for yellow light of wavelength $\lambda =589$nm).

| material | $n$ |
| --- | --- |
| air | 1.00029 |
| water | 1.33 |
| ice | 1.31 |
| glass | 1.52 |
| light flint | 1.58 |
| heavy flint | 1.65 |
| heaviest flint | 1.89 |
| diamond | 2.42 |

The law of refraction follows directly from the fact that the speed $v$ with which light propagates through a dielectric medium is inversely proportional to the refractive index of the medium $v = \frac{c}{n}$, where $c$ is the speed of the light.

| ![refraction](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/Refraction-of-light-in-water20150805-30610-expmepedited.png) | ![low of refraction](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/law-refraction-angle-light-ray-Snell-medium.gif) |
|---- | ---- | 

[**The amount of bending depends on two things:**](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/49-refraction-of-light)
- **Change in speed** – if a substance causes the light to speed up or slow down more, it will refract (bend) more.
- **Angle of the incident ray** – if the light is entering the substance at a greater angle, the amount of refraction will also be more noticeable. On the other hand, if the light is entering the new substance from straight on (at 90° to the surface), the light will still slow down, but it won’t change direction at all.

The law of refraction, also known as [Snell’s law](https://www.britannica.com/science/Snells-law), describes the relationship between the angle of incidence ($\phi_1$) and the angle of refraction ($\phi_2$), measured with respect to the normal (“perpendicular line”) to the surface, in mathematical terms: $n_1 sin \phi_1 = n_2 sin \phi_2$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the index of refraction of the first and second media, respectively.

> ***These equations will tell you how much light will going to.****

$$transmitted + reflected + absorbed = \text{total amount of light}$$

$$\text{(reflection)  }R=(\frac{n_t-n_i}{n_t+n_i})^2$$

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations#Normal_incidence) assume the $\phi_i = \phi_t = 0$.

$$T=\frac{4n_i n_t}{(n_t+n_i)^2}$$

When the light goes throught several surfaces we can sum is as different refractions. This happens wen we use lenses and it is described by the [lensmaker's equation](http://www.physicsbootcamp.org/lens-maker-equation.html): $\frac{1}{f} = (n-1)(\frac{1}{R_1}-\frac{1}{R_2})$ where $f$ is the focal length, and $R_1$, $R_2$ are the radius of the circle which create the lens. When one surface of the lens is flat than then it means that you can set $R_2 = \infty$. Also you can set the thickness of the lens by $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{(n_1-n_0)}{n_0}(\frac{1}{R_1}-\frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{(n_1-n_0)d}{n_1R_1R_2})$  If the lens is operating in air, then set $n_0=1$, like in the previous equation.

At the focus point the light is has a distribution density.

![focus_point](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/refractive_lenses_and_image_formation/focus_point.png)

**Ray tracing:** parallel rays will go to the focus after lens and and will be parallel after lens if it comes from a focus.

*Thin lens equation:* $\frac{1}{f} = (\frac{1}{s_0} + \frac{1}{s_i})$ where $s_0$ is the distance from the object to the lens, and $s_i$ is the distance from lens to image and $f$ is the focal length of the lens.

*magnification:* $M=\frac{y_i}{y_0}=- \frac{s_i}{s_0}$ where $y_0$ is the object and $y_i$ is the image height.

The relationship between the focal lengths of the objective lens ($f_{obj}$), tube lens ($f_{tube}$), and the total magnification (M) is given by the formula: $M=-\frac{f_{tube}}{f_{obj}}$

## Microscope Imaging and Koehler Illumination (Ron Vale, HHMI/UCSF)

> This lecture covers the lenses of the microscope and how they are used to focus light onto a specimen and how light from the specimen is focused onto a camera or the retina of an eye.  Koehler illumination, which provides even illumination of a sample, is described.


*info:* many microscope lens created earlier than 20 years has a 160mm image distance.

Nowdays mostly we use infinity lens whith tube lens. In this case the magnification will be $M=\frac{f_1}{f_0}$ where $f_1$ is the focal length of the tube lens and $f_0$ is the focal length of the objective lens which is a much smaller number. 

| ![tube lens](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscope%20Imaging%20and%20Koehler%20Illumination%20(Ron%20Vale)/tubelens.png) | ![projecting_the_imge_to_your_eye](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscope%20Imaging%20and%20Koehler%20Illumination%20(Ron%20Vale)/projecting_the_imge_to_your_eye.png) | ![projecting_the_imge_to_camera](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscope%20Imaging%20and%20Koehler%20Illumination%20(Ron%20Vale)/projecting_the_imge_to_camera.png) |
| ----- | ---- | ---- |

Here as you see we used [eyepiece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyepiece), we will talk about this later.


### The other question is the illumination of the microscope

With the Köhler illumination we can have defocused light  which don't disturb the image.

| ![köhler_illumination](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscope%20Imaging%20and%20Koehler%20Illumination%20(Ron%20Vale)/keohler.png) | ![köhler illumination, the path of the light and the path of the image](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/1024px-Kohler_Illumination_en.svg.png) |
| --------------------- | --------- | 
| [Köhler illumination](https://www.scientifica.uk.com/learning-zone/a-6-step-guide-to-koehler-illumination) | [Schematics of Köhler illumination.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6hler_illumination) Top: Illumination beam path, conjugated planes marked with the light green bar. Bottom: Imaging beam path, conjugated planes marked with the light blue bar. See text for further details. |

[Critical illumination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_illumination) (below), focuses an image of a light source on to the specimen for bright illumination. Critical illumination generally has problems with evenness of illumination as an image of the illumination source (for example a halogen lamp filament) is visible in the resulting image. Köhler illumination has largely replaced critical illumination in modern scientific light microscopy although it requires additional optics which may not be present in less expensive and simpler light microscopes.

### Conjugate focal plane
> In optics, a [conjugate plane or conjugate focal plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_focal_plane) of a given plane P, is the plane P′ such that points on P are imaged on P′. If an object is moved to the point occupied by its image, then the moved object's new image will appear at the point where the object originated.

The field diaphragm simply controls the amount of light which finally reaches the slide on the stage. By controlling the amount of light coming from the light source, you are able to reduce glare from the source and this results in images with greater contrast. The field diaphragm is usually controlled by a knurled ring around the lens.

| ---- | ----- |
| The image of field diaphragm has an image on the sample and on the camer as well, but this works only with proper Köhler illumination. | [The main components of an upright microscope.](https://www.leica-microsystems.com/science-lab/microscopy-basics/koehler-illumination-a-brief-history-and-a-practical-set-up-in-five-easy-steps/) The Field diaphragm controls the intensity of light from the source. The condenser focusses the light from the light source on the specimen. The aperture diaphragm controls the angle of the illumination light cone.  |

> Microscope lenses are highly complex optical elements that correct for many different optical aberrations. This lecture describes a number of these aberrations and discusses what you should consider when selecting objective lenses as well as other precautions you can take to reduce the effects of aberrations.

### Optical Aberrations
It is always a tradeoff between the correction versus transmission and numerical aperture. Plan version are flat-field corrected, so that when you look in the eyepiece you can see a flat corrected field.

Apochromat lenses are the more correctted lenses, but don't forget, more glass in the lens to correct the lens, more transmission is losed!

| ![lenstypesandcorrections](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/lenstypesandcorrections.png) | ![aberrations](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/aberration.png) | ![numerical aperture](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/numericalaperture.png) |

#### Numerical aperture
> More in [ Encyclopedia of Materials: Science and Technology (Second Edition)](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/related_documents/Optical_Microscopy-AS_HOLIK.pdf)
 
$$NA = nsin\phi$$
Where $NA$ is [numerical aperture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/sdfe/pdf/download/eid/3-s2.0-B0080431526011426/first-page-pdf), $n$ is the refractive index of the medium between the objective lens and the object *(air = 1.0; water = 1.33, oil = 1.515)*; $sin\phi$ is the angle of the cone of illumination; $\phi$ is half the angular aperture (or acceptance angle of image-forming rays) of the objective lens. This is why we can increase the magnification with immersion media.

| ![numerical_aperture](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/numerical_aperture.png) | ![immersion_media](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/immersion_media.png) |
| ------------------- |----- |

#### Curvature of field 
Due the curved surface of the lens you cant get the focus of the whole image at the same time.

Curvature of field is present when the sharpest image is formed not on a flat plane but on a curved surface. See in the thrd image, the image "plane" (the arc) deviates from a flat surface (the vertical line).

| ![fieldcurvature](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/fieldcurvature.png) | ![Curvature of field](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/aberration-curvature-field.gif) | ![Field curvature: the image "plane" (the arc) deviates from a flat surface (the vertical line).](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/Field_curvature.svg) |
| ------------------- |----- | --- |

#### Astigmatism
A point source of the light which appears as a line or ellipse, and when you go through focus it changes its directionality in other way. High quality lenses don't heve such, just if you drop it. Occurs when thelens is curved more steeply in one direction than in another. [On the right picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism_(optical_systems)) you can see the image of point G is at point $B_M$ for rays in plane M, and at point $B_S$ for rays in plane S.

| ![astigmatism](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/astigmatism.png) | ![Astigmatism: The image of point G is at point BM for rays in plane M, and at point BS for rays in plane S.](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/Meridional%2BSagittalPlane.png) |
| ------------------- |----- |

#### Coma
Coma of a single lens: each cone of light focuses on different planes along the optical axis.

| ![coma](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/coma.png) | ![coma](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/realted_images/Lens_coma.svg) |
| ------------------- |----- |

#### Axial chromatic and spherical aberration
Each manufacturer matching the immersion oil to their lenses, because other type can  induce axial chromatic aberration. The spherical aberration appears because in the reality there is no such thing as ideal thin lens, they have volume and curved surfaces. Common causes of spherical aberration  are the incorrect slip thickness, mismatch of the reflective index. 

| ![chromatic](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/chromatic.png) | ![wrongimmersionoilinducechromaticaberration]() | ![spherical](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/spherical.png) | ![spherical_aberration](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/spherical_aberration.png) | ![spherical_in_reality](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/Microscopy%20Objectives%20and%20Eyepieces%20(Stephen%20Ross)/spherical_in_reality.png) |
| ------------------- |----- |----- |----- |----- |

Because of this nowdays the lens systems are extreamly complex systems. To solve this we have to know the optical path length. The $OPL$ is the physical length of every material in that optical system, times its refractive index, summed up through the entire lens system to the point in the specimen that you'are imaging. 

$$OPL = ((L_1 \times n_1) + (L_2 \times n_2) ... + (L_n \times n_n))$$

Where $L$ is the physical distance, $n$ is the refractive index of the mounting media *(air = 1.0; water = 1.33, glycerin=1.47, oil = 1.515)*
But in this equation the immersion media is a variable, immersion media decreases its refractive index as it warms up! Coverglasses ha a 10% $\pm$ thickness range. The specimen may vary in a long range, depends on the material.
