Resolving power of the light microscope; the [resolution limits of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system): $d=\frac{\lambda}{2nsin\alpha}$ where $d$ is the distance about how far apart two objects are where they can still be distinguised as separate objects; $Î»$ is the wavelength of light; $n$ is the index of refraction of the medium being imaged in; and $\alpha$ is the half-angle subtended by the optical objective lens.


Green Fluorescence Protein is not compatible with the live cell imaging but is a subtatial improvement over immonuflourescence.
