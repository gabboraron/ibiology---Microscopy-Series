## Historical Contributions from Light Microscopy: What Can You Learn with a Light Microscope? (Ron Vale, HHMI/UCSF)

Resolving power of the light microscope; the [resolution limits of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system): $d=\frac{\lambda}{2nsin\alpha}$ where $d$ is the distance about how far apart two objects are where they can still be distinguised as separate objects; $λ$ is the wavelength of light; $n$ is the index of refraction of the medium being imaged in; and $\alpha$ is the half-angle subtended by the optical objective lens. Here $nsin\alpha$ is the [numerical aperture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_aperture) that characterizes the range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light.

Green Fluorescence Protein is not compatible with the live cell imaging but is a subtatial improvement over immonuflourescence.

## Refractive Lenses and Image Formation (Daniel Fletcher, UC Berkeley)

> Light microscopes use lenses. The basic properties of light, how light interacts with matter, the principles behind refractive lenses and how lenses form (magnified) images will be introduced in this talk.


speed = wavelength (m) x frequency (1/s)

intensity = power / area

amplitude = $\sqrt{intensity}$

frequency = $\frac{speed}{wavelength}$

refraction = $\frac{\text{speed of light in vacuum}}{\text{speed of light in material}}$

law of reflection: $\phi_{in} = \phi_{out}$
