Resolving power of the light microscope; the [resolution limits of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system): $d=\frac{\lambda}{2nsin\alpha}$ where $d$ is the distance about how far apart two objects are where they can still be distinguised as separate objects; $λ$ is the wavelength of light; $n$ is the index of refraction of the medium being imaged in; and $\alpha$ is the half-angle subtended by the optical objective lens. Here $nsin\alpha$ is the [numerical aperture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_aperture) that characterizes the range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light.

Green Fluorescence Protein is not compatible with the live cell imaging but is a subtatial improvement over immonuflourescence.

> Light microscopes use lenses. The basic properties of light, how light interacts with matter, the principles behind refractive lenses and how lenses form (magnified) images will be introduced in this talk.


> ***These equations will tell you where the light it's going to go.***

speed = wavelength (m) x frequency (1/s)

intensity = power / area

amplitude = $\sqrt{intensity}$

frequency = $\frac{speed}{wavelength}$

refraction *(sign:* $n$ *)* = $\frac{\text{speed of light in vacuum}}{\text{speed of light in material}}$

### Light - matter interaction:

**[law of reflection](https://www.britannica.com/science/reflection-physics): $\phi_{in} = \phi_{out}$**

The angle of incidence is equal with the reflection.

**Refraction is the bending of light (it also happens with sound, water and other waves) as it passes from one transparent substance into another. [Law of refrection](https://www.britannica.com/science/refraction): $n_isin(\phi_i) = n_rsin(\phi_t)$** In this [equation](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/316/lectures/node128.html) $\phi_1$ is the angle subtended between the incident ray and the normal to the interface, and $\phi_2$ is the angle subtended between the refracted ray and the normal to the interface. The quantities $n_1$ and $n_2$ are termed the refractive indices of media 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, the law of refraction predicts that a light-ray always deviates more towards the normal in the optically denser medium: i.e., the medium with the higher refractive index. By definition, the refractive index $n$ of a dielectric medium of dielectric constant $K$ is given by $n=\sqrt{K}$. [Table](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/316/lectures/node128.html#t12.1) below shows the refractive indices of some common materials (for yellow light of wavelength $\lambda =589$nm).

| material | $n$ |
| --- | --- |
| air | 1.00029 |
| water | 1.33 |
| ice | 1.31 |
| glass | 1.52 |
| light flint | 1.58 |
| heavy flint | 1.65 |
| heaviest flint | 1.89 |
| diamond | 2.42 |

The law of refraction follows directly from the fact that the speed $v$ with which light propagates through a dielectric medium is inversely proportional to the refractive index of the medium $v = \frac{c}{n}$, where $c$ is the speed of the light.

[**The amount of bending depends on two things:**](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/49-refraction-of-light)
- **Change in speed** – if a substance causes the light to speed up or slow down more, it will refract (bend) more.
- **Angle of the incident ray** – if the light is entering the substance at a greater angle, the amount of refraction will also be more noticeable. On the other hand, if the light is entering the new substance from straight on (at 90° to the surface), the light will still slow down, but it won’t change direction at all.

The law of refraction, also known as [Snell’s law](https://www.britannica.com/science/Snells-law), describes the relationship between the angle of incidence ($\phi_1$) and the angle of refraction ($\phi_2$), measured with respect to the normal (“perpendicular line”) to the surface, in mathematical terms: $n_1 sin \phi_1 = n_2 sin \phi_2$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the index of refraction of the first and second media, respectively.

> ***These equations will tell you how much light will going to.****

$$transmitted + reflected + absorbed = \text{total amount of light}$$

$$\text{(reflection)  }R=(\frac{n_t-n_i}{n_t+n_i})^2$$

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations#Normal_incidence) assume the $\phi_i = \phi_t = 0$.

$$T=\frac{4n_i n_t}{(n_t+n_i)^2}$$

When the light goes throught several surfaces we can sum is as different refractions. This happens wen we use lenses and it is described by the [lensmaker's equation](http://www.physicsbootcamp.org/lens-maker-equation.html): $\frac{1}{f} = (n-1)(\frac{1}{R_1}-\frac{1}{R_2})$ where $f$ is the focal length, and $R_1$, $R_2$ are the radius of the circle which create the lens. When one surface of the lens is flat than then it means that you can set $R_2 = \infty$. Also you can set the thickness of the lens by $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{(n_1-n_0)}{n_0}(\frac{1}{R_1}-\frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{(n_1-n_0)d}{n_1R_1R_2})$  If the lens is operating in air, then set $n_0=1$, like in the previous equation.

At the focus point the light is has a distribution density.

![focus_point](https://github.com/gabboraron/ibiology---Microscopy-Series/blob/main/images_from_the_videos/refractive_lenses_and_image_formation/focus_point.png)

**Ray tracing:** parallel rays will go to the focus after lens and and will be parallel after lens if it comes from a focus.

*Thin lens equation:* $\frac{1}{f} = (\frac{1}{s_0} + \frac{1}{s_i})$ where $s_0$ is the distance from the object to the lens, and $s_i$ is the distance from lens to image and $f$ is the focal length of the lens.

*magnification:* $M=\frac{y_i}{y_0}=- \frac{s_i}{s_0}$ where $y_0$ is the object and $y_i$ is the image height.

The relationship between the focal lengths of the objective lens ($f_{obj}$), tube lens ($f_{tube}$), and the total magnification (M) is given by the formula: $M=-\frac{f_{tube}}{f_{obj}}$
